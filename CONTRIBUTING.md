# Contributing to list

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the awesome production machine learning list!

The key things to bare in mind when contributing a new list are the following:
* This is not an exhaustive listing, but a listing of tools that are recommended to be checked out
* Repository being contributed must be active and maintained
* All contributions must be done in alphabetical order relative to the section
* The library should not be repeated across more than one section
* In order to propose a new section, please add an issue first for discussion

Thank you again, if you have any questions please feel free to open an issue.
